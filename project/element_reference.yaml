# This is the configuration file defining the how units should be converted and for
#   user-interface descriptions
#
# NOTE: ALL CALCULATIONS ARE EXECUTED IN SI STANDARD UNITS.
#
# When the analysis is run, the values are converted to standard SI units based on
#   what units are specified here. For example:
#     - If the unit here is "km", it will automatically be recognized and the value of
#       the corresponding parameter will be converted to "m"
#     - If the unit here is "m", it will be recognized that the value does not need conversion
#
# Additionally, the values will be converted back to these units after analysis
